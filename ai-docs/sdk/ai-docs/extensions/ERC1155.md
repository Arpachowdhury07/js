## Description

The **ERC‑1155 extension** lets you work with multi‑token (semi‑fungible) contracts that house many tokenIds under one contract. Helpers cover balance queries, batch transfers, mint/burn, drop mechanics, and event subscriptions.

## Import Cheatsheet

```ts
import {
  // Reads
  balanceOf,
  balanceOfBatch,
  totalSupply,
  uri,
  // Writes
  mintTo,
  mintBatchTo,
  transferFrom,
  burn,
} from "thirdweb/extensions/erc1155";
```

## Examples

### Mint 100 tokens of id 42 to a wallet

```ts no‑lint
const tx = mintTo({ contract, to: user, tokenId: 42n, amount: 100n });
await sendAndConfirmTransaction({ account: admin, transaction: tx });
```

### Check wallet's balance for two ids

```ts
const [swords, shields] = await balanceOfBatch({
  contract,
  owner: myAddr,
  tokenIds: [1n, 2n],
});
```

### Claim via Drop

```ts
const tx = claimTo({ contract, to: user, tokenId: 10n, quantity: 5n });
```
