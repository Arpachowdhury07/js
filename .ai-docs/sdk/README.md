The documentation in this folder is intended for consumption when interacting with and building on top of the SDK for the Thirdweb protocol.

The following constitutes the main part of the SDK:

- The React components that are used to interact with the Thirdweb API and protocol.
- The React hooks.
- Any data types involved with the hooks and components
- Classes and methods that are used with the SDK, separate from the React side.
