## Aggregation Queries

### How do I use aggregations in my queries?
You can include aggregation functions directly in your API requests. Here's an example:
```typescript
// Get total transaction value and average gas used
const response = await fetch(
  'https://10.insight.thirdweb.com/v1/transactions?aggregate=count() AS transaction_count&aggregate=sum(value) AS total_value_wei&aggregate=avg(gas_used) AS avg_gas_used'
);
```

### Where can I find examples of using aggregations?
You can find working examples and experiment with different aggregation presets in the Insight Playground. The Playground provides a user-friendly interface to build and test your aggregation queries.

### What are some common use cases for aggregations?
- Calculating total trading volume
- Finding average transaction values
- Counting unique users/wallets
- Analyzing gas usage patterns
- Tracking NFT collection statistics

### Can I create custom aggregations?
Yes, you can create custom aggregations using standard SQL aggregation functions like `count()`, `sum()`, `avg()`, `min()`, `max()`, and `countDistinct()`. The presets are just convenient shortcuts for common operations.

### Where can I learn more about available presets?
You can find the complete list of available aggregation presets in the Insight Playground, where you can also test them with real blockchain data.
